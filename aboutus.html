      <p class="paragraph"><br /><strong>Ammunition is here to fulfill your legal desires..!!</strong><br />‍<br />Ever wondered what would be the reason for the Government of India to make such stringent regulations for the <strong>permission of
          weapon licenses</strong> ?... We are here to <strong>make it easy and simple for you</strong> and only you.<br /><br /> With seven children between them, the owners of Ammunition fully understand the responsibility of keeping their families
        safe. They also understand that simply <strong>dialing 100</strong> will not stop an aggressor from doing harm. Our respect and appreciation for law enforcement is absolute, but the fact is, a jacketed lead projectile has a much faster
        response time than the 10-minute national average response time to a 100 call. <br /><br />Therefore, it is our goal and our promise to provide the Indian public access to high-quality ammunition as fast as possible with the best customer
        service they have ever experienced. Not the best service in the industry, the best period.<br /><br /> As Ammunition has grown over the years, we have been able to create numerous <strong>jobs for hard-working Indians </strong>in our home
        country of India, as well as help many charities and foundations that support our troops, law enforcement, and the shooting sports. Our plan is to keep growing, keep creating jobs, keep giving, and keep Ammunition strong so that we can
        deliver the same great service for decades to come.<br /><br /><br />‍</p>
